Problem 1
---------

Using tidyverse library for data cleaning and analysis, leaps for stepwise selection, and the rest for cross validation

**Data cleaning and tidying**

``` r
raw_homicide = read_csv("./homicide-data.csv") 
homicide = raw_homicide %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", ")) %>%
  mutate(case_status = recode(disposition, "Closed without arrest" = "unsolved", 
                      "Open/No arrest" = "unsolved",
                      "Closed by arrest" = "solved")) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" & city_state != "Kansas City, MO" & city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>%
  mutate(race_general = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "white","non_white"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         race_general = fct_relevel(as.factor(race_general),"white")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Upon removing cities that do not have information that we need, and mutate variables such as `victim_age` and `victim_race`, the resulting dataset consists 48507 rows by 15 columns.
